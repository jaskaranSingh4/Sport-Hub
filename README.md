# Wireframe
Wireframes: A website wireframe, often called a screen blueprint, is a graphic illustration of a website's structural architecture. Wireframes are used to arrange components in the most efficient way to achieve a certain goal. A business goal and a creative concept are frequently the driving forces behind the goal. The wireframe displays the website's content page layout, including interface components and navigational mechanisms, as well as how they interact. I used figma website to create wireframes.

Responsive Web design: The goal of responsive web design is to create web pages that look great on any device. A responsive web design adjusts to changing screen sizes and viewports automatically. The use of HTML and CSS to automatically resize, conceal, reduce, or enlarge a website to make it seem excellent on all devices is known as responsive web design.
